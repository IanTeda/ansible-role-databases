# PostgreSQL Client Authentication Configuration (Minimal)
# =============================================================================
#
# The pg_hba.conf file is PostgreSQL's Host-Based Authentication configuration 
# file. It controls who can connect to PostgreSQL databases and how they must 
# authenticate.
# 
#
# This is a minimal configuration for local development and testing.
# For production use, customise the authentication rules as needed.
